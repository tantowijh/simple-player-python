# Voice Generator

The `voicegen` module allows you to convert text to speech and save it as an audio file using the `gtts` library.

To use the `voicegen` module, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import the `voicegen` class from the `voicegen` module:

    ```python
    from simpleplayer import voicegen
    ```
2. Create an instance of the voicegen class, providing the text, filename, and an optional language parameter:

    ```python
    voicegen(text, filename, lang='en')
    ```
    Replace text with the text you want to convert to speech, filename with the desired name of the output audio file, and lang with the language code (default is 'en').

3. If the internet connection is available, the text will be converted into speech and saved as an MP3 file with the specified filename.

<br>

Example usage:

```python
from simpleplayer import voicegen

# Generate the voice
voicegen("Hello, world!", "output")
```
This will generate an audio file named output.mp3 containing the speech for the text "Hello, world!".

<br>

## Terminal Usage
You can also use the voicegen module directly from the terminal:
```
voicegen "Hello, world!" output
```

Replace "Hello, world!" with the desired text and output with the desired filename (without the file extension). The generated audio file will be saved as output.mp3 in the current directory.

Note: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection to use the voicegen module successfully.
